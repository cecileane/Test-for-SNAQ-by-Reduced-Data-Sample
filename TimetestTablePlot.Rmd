This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
table1 = read.csv("Timetest table.csv", header = T)
table = rbind(table1[1,],table1[3:5,],table1[8:9,],table1[11:16,])
qplot(table$Log.lik, table$Total.CPU.Time)
qplot(table$Nfails, table$Log.lik)
qplot(table$Nfails, table$Total.CPU.Time)
qplot(table$ftolAbs, table$Log.lik)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
qplot(Nfails, Log.lik, data = table, 
      shape = factor(table$Best.Selected.Compared.to.Best.Topology),
      color = factor(ftolAbs),
      cex = factor(xtolAbs)) + scale_shape_manual(values = c(0,2)) 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
