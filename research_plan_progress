- read chapters 1-3 in 'tree-thinking' book
- for next week (but skip 3/3):
  read chapter 4 on trait evolution
  start software carpentry bootcamp


rough plan for next steps
- to be updated as necessary
- no ordering of reading/software/data analysis
- think/talk about timeline

Read to understand model/methods and to learn about bigger picture:

- read chapters from 'tree-thinking' book:
  chapter 6, gene trees & species trees
  chapter 7, parsimony to build trees
  chapter 8, models & likelihood inference (for gene trees)
  chapter 9, sections on bootstrap and on species tree methods
- read from "estimating species trees" book:
  chapter 1, intro & the coalescent process
  chapter 6, model on network
- read Yu, Degnan & Nakhleh (2012)
  on statistical methods to infer networks:
  http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002660
- read Solis-Lemus & Ane (2016), same model but faster method:
  http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06075

Software development:

- improve on existing functions and create new functions
  for analysis of data with multiple alleles (individuals) per species.
- get enterobacteria data (not preprocessed) to test new functions

Analysis of real data on enterobacteria: 

- Data from 2,000+ genes, 110 bacterial strains, 15 groups ("species")
- get data from Cecile (preprocessed)
- analyze with h=0 through h=5 (or more?)
  keep all analysis code organized (readme file etc.)
- select best h (number of hybridizations)
- perform bootstrap analysis to get support for edges in the network
- visualize results

Publication prospects:

- participate to manuscript on enterobacteria
- participate as package co-author for new functions
- use new functions on rhizobia data: publication down the line?
